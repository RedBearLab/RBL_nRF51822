RBL_nRF51822
============

RedBearLab nRF51822 is an integrated "ARM + BLE 4.0" developement board. It contains a Nordic nRF51822 SoC (ARM Cortex-M0 with BLE) and a Freescale MK20DX MCU (ARM Cortex-M4).

The MK20DX MCU acts as an interface chip that adds USB to the nRF58122 Soc so that user can load firmware.

This board is compatible to Arduino and it supports Arduino IDE for development. Also, it support mbed online development. 

It targets for makers, engineers and students to develop low power Internet-Of-Things (IoT) projects/prototypes quickly and easily.
