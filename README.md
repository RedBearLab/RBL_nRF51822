This repository contains the resources for the RedBearLab nRF51822 BLE development board.

RBL nRF51822 is an integrated "ARM + BLE 4.0" development board. It contains a Nordic nRF51822 SoC (ARM Cortex-M0 with BLE) and a Freescale MK20DX MCU (ARM Cortex-M4).

The MK20DX MCU acts as an interface chip that adds USB to the board so that user can upload firmware to the target nRF51822 chip. For more about the USB interface, please see the [USB-IF](USB-IF) folder.

This board is compatible to Arduino and it supports Arduino IDE for development, refer to the [nRF51822-Arduino](https://github.com/redbearlab/nRF51822-Arduino/) repository.

Also, it supports [mbed](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/RedBearLab-nRF51822/) for online development. 

This board targets for makers, engineers and students to develop low power Internet-Of-Things (IoT) projects/prototypes quickly and easily.
